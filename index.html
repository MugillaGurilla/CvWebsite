                      These sessions are QAs time to ensure that the ticket is as it should be.

                    <p> 
                      Goals are meant to be set long in advance but it rarely worked out this way. Often I’d hear in the morning that something needs to be ready for the afternoon and have to ensure that it is ready.

                    <p>
                      As with all food products, documentation and analysis of the product from grain to glass is important. This takes the form of taking and recording pH, gravity (a measure of sugar within the product), oxygen levels, CO2 levels and clarity.

              My goal is always to make easier the jobs of the people around me, which I'm sure any team will appreciate. Below are a few testimonials from people I've worked with that demonstrate this, among other things. In fact, two of whom, having never ever met, independently used the term "willingness to help." 
              In summary, I think I'm pleasant to work with.

                    Cormac volunteered with Into Games to help us put on a Career Stage at W.A.S.D. ‘23 in London and has been instrumental in the success of this event. <br><br>
                    He has shown great teamwork, collaboration & willingness to help and I commend him especially for taking on a role that requires facilitation & organisation skills. He proved he has a passion for making the games industry accessible and welcoming for as many people as possible. <br><br>
                    Furthermore, he took part in our C++ Training Programme, where he was a student that showed collaboration skills, teamwork, technical expertise & willingness to learn. I would recommend him to any workplace on the search for someone who is keen to learn and grow within a technical role.

                    I have worked extensively with Cormac, as a Senior Developer on the same team at Immediate Media over the last year. I have been consistently impressed by his inquisitiveness and attention to detail. He is always thorough, and proactive about learning new technologies and skills. His work consistently raises the standard of the whole team. <br><br>
                    Cormac regularly goes beyond the task at hand, taking responsibility for improving our processes. He approaches problems with the spirit of an engineer, automating areas of repetitiveness to make the whole team faster and more reliable. He concerns himself with more than just the code, regularly contributing useful ideas and criticisms at team retrospectives, and improving our ways of working. <br><br>
                    Operating significantly above what is typically expected of engineers in his role and experience, Cormac has a bright future in the industry and will be an asset to any project. I am excited to see what he achieves in the future.

                    During our intensive Test Automation Engineer training program, Cormac’s work was often used as an example of best practice from a technical perspective. He was always willing to support, working together with others to collaborate to further understand the complex tasks set and did so in a friendly and professional manner.

                    Cormac was a pleasure to work with during the training at Sparta Global as he was always quick to pick up and learn about software testing and any new concepts within testing, C#, or OOP. <br><br>
                    He excelled in all parts of our training, with a strong area being in the technical side as he was able to pick up fundamentals and apply them very quickly and often helped other people who may be struggling, explaining complex topics in a way that is easy to understand. <br><br>
                    Cormac’s contribution to our cohort's Website testing project was invaluable as he would often solve problems with the framework, help debug other peoples code and take the navigator role to ensure the code was written to the highest standard.
